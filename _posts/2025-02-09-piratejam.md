I'll be participating in [PirateSoftware](https://gopiratesoftware.com/)'s 17th [GameJam](https://itch.io/jam/pirate)!

It's scheduled to happen on July 17th to 31st, in five months.

Till then, I'll be working on the [Spock game engine](https://codeberg.org/Laxystem/Spock)
(it's not dead, I have tons of unpushed changes). Here's [its documentation](https://codeberg.laxla.quest/Spock)
(if the link doesn't work, try [this one](https://github.laxla.quest/Spock)).a

I'm attempting to make Spock a fully concurrent game engine,
a concept that nearly doesn't exist. This means it'll use a limited variation on ECS.
But it also means it'll be very hard to complete the engine on time.
But I'll try, and that's what's important, is it not?

But this also comes with a sadder announcement. This is me trying to focus on and fix my own life, as a part of an attmept to pursue a career in gamedev (as an Israeli, I'm statisticslly likely to succeed: all five Israeli gamedevs seem to do great /j). From now on (or really, since Decemeber), I'll be contributing less to JoinFedivri on the code side of things. But I'm helping translate Codeberg to Hebrew (I've [proposed](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/governance/issues/220) myself as member of the Forgejo localization team) as I still care about the project and want to help. I'm still the ratifier, but due to advances from the concept stage to the prototyping stage, I don't think it matters anymore.

I'd make this longer, but it's late right nowâ€”do stay tuned!
I'll be making a more detailed post in the future.
