I'll be participating in [PirateSoftware](https://gopiratesoftware.com/)'s 17th [GameJam](https://itch.io/jam/pirate)!

It's scheduled to happen on July 17th to 31st, in five months.

Till then, I'll be working on the [Spock game engine](https://codeberg.org/Laxystem/Spock)
(it's not dead, I have tons of unpushed changes). Here's [its documentation](https://codeberg.laxla.quest/Spock)
(if the link doesn't work, try [this one](https://github.laxla.quest/Spock)).a

I'm attempting to make Spock a fully concurrent game engine,
a concept that nearly doesn't exist. This means it'll use a limited variation on ECS.
But it also means it'll be very hard to complete the engine on time.
But I'll try, and that's what's important, is it not?

I'd make this longer, but its late right nowâ€”do stay tuned!
I'll be making a more detailed post in the future.
