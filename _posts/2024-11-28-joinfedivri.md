Well, if you haven't heard, I'm the ratifier of [JoinFedivri](https://codeberg.org/JoinFedivri).

## What's That?

It's an Israeli attempt to create a proper Israeli social network.
Currently, most Israelis are on a combination of WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, Discord, TikTok, Instagram and BlueSky;
all corporate websites, and all but-ish the latter centralized.

It's also a Hebrew attempt to bring more people to Fedivri (Fed + Ivri, Hebrew for "of Hebrew"), the Hebrew Fediverse.

## Well, what about Arab Israelis, then?

Although we *are* trying to have more people, well, join Fedivri, we're actually planning on our social network being bilingual.

## And Palestinians?

We're not going to exclude *anyone*. However, it is unlikely that Palestinians would be interested in joining;
but we'd be happy to help found a sister server!

## Wait, Israeli? Does that mean you're *insert politics*?

No. We do not embrace any political idoelogy, and forbid racist, xenophobic, and homophobic talking points on our services.

## Anyway, what did you say a 'Ratifier' does?

The Ratifier, or in Hebrew, "מאשררת" (feminine) and "מאשרר" (masculine),
decides when a discussion is ready for a vote, and performs all kinds of daily maintenance.

## But didn't you say everyone are already on other networks?

Yes, I did, but here's some context:
* WhatsApp and Discord are used for messaging.
* Telegram is mostly used for, let's call it, *alternative* news sources, and borderline illegal stuff (as usual for Telegram).
* Facebook is a more personal social network, and it's only used by Millennials and Boomers anyway.
* TikTok and Instagram have a widely different content form.
* And yes, a lot of people are on BlueSky. But, *we'll natively support [ATProto](https://atproto.com)*,
  the protocol BlueSky is based on, *in addition* to ActivityPub.

## Support how? What're you gonna run, anyway?

Well, we've looked into a lot of options.
* We saw no reaosn to use [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) or any of its forks.
* We considered using [Sharkey](https://joinsharkey.org), but ultimately decided it is too complex for our liking.
* We also looked into [Bonfire](https://bonfirenetworks.org), but considering it is still in beta for over three years now,
  and the amount of bugs we encountered, we gave up on it.

We now have three last options:
* [Hubzilla](https://hubzilla.org) — its UI is quite complex, and we would need to mosify it a lot.
  If you're a PHP and/or CSS developer, we would [love to get your help](https://codeberg.org/JoinFedivri/JoinFedivri/issues/12).
* [Friendica](https://friendi.ca/) — we aren't done checking it out *yet*, but it looks promising – it aleady has BlueSky support!
* And finally, [our own solution](http://codeberg.org/JoinFedivri/JoinFedivri/issues/13).

## Wait, if this is a Hebrew social network, why is this post in English?

Because this post's target audience is non-Hebrew speakers, who cannot be a part of our Hebrew conversations.

## What's the name of this social netowrk gonna be, then?

I won't tell you. We haven't bought the domain yet, so we'd prefer to keep this knowledge to the smallest group possible —
in this case, Hebrew speakers. We'll refer to it as "Join Fedivri" for now, K?

## Will I be able to join it when it's up?

Yes, but it'd be very preferable if you're a Hebrew speaker, as a first language or not — otherwise, you simply won't find what to do here.

## Can I help?

Yes. See:
* Matrix, in [Hebrew](https://matrix.to/#/#JoinFedivri:matrix.org) or [English](https://matrix.to/#/#JoinFedivri_English:matrix.org).
* [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/JoinFedivri/JoinFedivri) (in Hebrew).
* The `#JoinFedivri` tag on the Fediverse.
* [@laxystem@tooot.im](https://tooot.im/@laxystem) (in Hebrew).
* This very blog.
