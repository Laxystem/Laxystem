This is a very complex(-ified) topic everyone has a different take on, and I'm not very interested in inaccurately rewriting my thoughts about it again and again;
So here it is, fully.

# Terminology

The two sides of this conflict use widely different meanings for various terms. In this post,
* **Directly involved organization** refers to Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran.
* **Israel** refers to the State of Israel.
* **Israel Palestine** refers to all land under Israel or Palestine at the time of [Rabbin's assassination][Assassination of Rabbin], including Gaza.
* **Judea** refers to the *current* government of Israel, as of 2024.
* **Judea and Samaria** is the transliteration of the Hebrew name for the West Bank, "יהודה ושומרון".
* **Kahanism**[^1] refers to the flavour of Jewish Supremacy started by [Meir Kahane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Kahane)
  and continued by [Ben Gvir] (the ideology American pro-Palestinians call "Zionism").
* **Lebanon** refers to the State of Lebanon, not neccessarily Hizballah.
* **Levant** refers to the geographical core of the conflict: Israel, Palestine, Gaza, Lebanon, Jordan.
* **Palestine** refers to the de-facto non-existant State of Palestine.
* **Palestinian Authority**, or **PA** refers to the autonomous council ruling the West Bank.
* **Racism** has its usual meaning, with a twist: In Israel Palestine
* **Zionism** refers to Israeli patriotism (that is, the Israeli meaning).

# The Parties Involved

I don't think it is rational to form a take on a conflict without first understanding the motives of all involved parties; Therfore, here's an alphabetical list of them, for your convenience.

Note, as the only recently-democratic directly involved organization (and due to its own assassinations), Israel has a much more stable and therefore, relevant web of motivations in its government than other organizations;
I'm not going to bother documenting Hamas' nor Hezbollah's weekly designated survivors, and as an Israeli, I do not have nearly enough information about specific members of the Iranian government to document it sufficiently.

## Israel

The current government is dependent on four things:
* The Israeli population's acceptence of the need for the war (this is why a lot of Israelis oppose ceasefires; they truly believe the war is *needed*).
* The Palestinian population's lack of ability to organize without support from bodys with different motives, such as [Iran], its proxies, or the [Palestinian Authority].
* External Funding and Trade, due to [Netanjahu]'s abolishment of support for local farming, weapon factories, etc. the last decade,
  in addition to Obama restricting usage of American funding to American soil.

### The Netanjahus

[Ben Gvir] has holds the Netanjahus as political hostages — in the last elections, [B. Netanjahu] did not win enough votes to become Prime Minister without allying with supremacist parties,
who can therefore exit the coalition any time, immediately ending Netanjahu's term. That is: B. Netanjahu is *not* fully in charge. Ben Gvir, and perhaps [his wife][S. Netanjahu], are.
*This does not mean he's innocent of his countless crimes*.

The Netanjahus have a son currently (2024) living in the USA under government protection, Ya'ir Netanjahu, who was involved in *several* racist controversies;
Some of their political, whole-country-affecting decisions can be atributted to trying to protect their son; It is plausible they're Helicopter parents and a threat to their son,
to them, is a threat to the entire nation; therefore, it is likely they'll attempt to establish a monarchy some time in the future.

#### Prime Minister Binyamin Netanjahu

He's a classic case of political egoism; He's sure that without him, the State of Israel cannot survive, and therefore, to keep him on his throne (and in his point of view, to save Israel),
any action is justifiable; He cannot differentiate between his own interests and the people's, and
he will do anything to remain in power, regardless of how it seems to harm his ideology, country, or party.

#### Sara Netanjahu

Theorerized by the Israeli Left and Center to puppeteer her husband, known to abuse the staff of The House of the Prime Minister (Israel's version of the White House), she is generally considered by non-Bibist Israelis to be a, quote, "greedy sadistic control freak leeching off of public funds".

This being true is largely irrelevant; As all of the Netanjahus' actions (and therefore, motives) would then be atributted to Sara instead of Binyamin.

### Ben Gvir and Kahanism

Ben Gvir is a Kahanist, the ideology non-famously described by a Kahanist Rabbi to be different from Nazism simply due to "being correct"[^1].

Now, before you read the rest of this: I'm not being racist (I could not care less about the exact word) here.
Most Haredim truly, *truly* live on public funds without contributing to society at all. It is very important for you to understand this.
Their job is to pray and study a book they remember by heart by the age of 12, and they're paid to do so by the government.
They're wildly uneducated in anything beyond religious studies; They do not learn math, science, anything; And this results in them using even *more* public funds,
as an uneducated society, for example, would eat more sugar (there are statistics somewhere; but take this as an example), causing them to need more dental services,
which are paid for by the public (as Israel is a welfare state)! I'm not calling against any Haredi here; they're victims, their vote being automatically bought by politicians on birth, and even worse,
using others' money. Truly, the perfect heist.

Haredim, as you might've gussed from my introduction to this section, are Ben Gvir's and Kahanism's main voterbase and [bloc vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_bloc) for whoever their Rabbi tells them to;
Therefore, Ben Gvir is pressured by said Rabbis to deliver on his promises, and he does so mainly using [Trump] tactics: announcing horrible, terrible things,
forcing people to get used to them (except with more, "it's war, and he's an idiot anyway, what can we do", denial-of-wtf than "It's free speech so he can", this is *not* America);
This is why Ben Gvir often tweets and says things that ultimately hinder his cause; As if he didn't, the Rabbis would disapprove of him and select a new guy to fill the position;
This is a "do not assasinate, for there are worse" situation.

Speaking of the "DoNt AF Them AW" rule, Ben Gvir's trying to put all Arabs under a light of "criminals", that way he can justify destroying their homes and building new, free (rule of thumb: "if it ain't free it ain't for a Haredi"),
shiny ones for his Rabbis and their followers to excitedly colonize;
This is why:
* The Israeli government is violating said "DoNt AF Them AW" rule: to create a more bloodthirsty, more violant Hamas and Hezbollah, legitimizing Ben Gvir's agenda.
* Druze people, who likely suffered the most from this war, and yet are still serving in the IDF, do not get proper treatment;
  Ben Gvir is just waiting for them to grow tired of this so he could frame them, and therefore, all Israeli Arabs (who've truly became a part of Israeli society due to the war, a situation Ben Gvir dislikes),
  as criminals.
* Crime in Israeli Arab society was never solved; Such a thing would go directly against Ben Gvir's, and other, less-extremist politicians' agendas.
* Ben Gvir is trying to takeover the Israeli police and/or found a private militia;
  making people look like criminals is much easier when you can arrest them whenever it's most conenvient for you, instead of having to wait for unimportant things such as truth and reality.
  It's also useful for silencing those pesky protesters that cause your Rabbis to think you aren't doing your job well, and that you should be replaced.
