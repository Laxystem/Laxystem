This is a very complex(-ified) topic everyone has a different take on, and I'm not very interested in inaccurately rewriting my thoughts about it again and again;
So here it is, fully.

# Terminology

The two sides of this conflict use widely different meanings for various terms. In this post,
* **Israel** refers to the State of Israel.
* **Israel Palestine** refers to all land under Israel or Palestine at the time of [Rabbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin)'s
  [assassination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Yitzhak_Rabin), including Gaza.
* **Judea** refers to the *current* government of Israel, as of 2024.
* **Judea and Samaria** is the transliteration of the Hebrew name for the West Bank, "יהודה ושומרון".
* **Kahanism**[^1] refers to the flavour of Jewish Supremacy started by [Meir Kahane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Kahane)
  and continued by [Ben Gvir] (the ideology American pro-Palestinians call "Zionism").
* **Lebanon** refers to the State of Lebanon, not neccessarily Hizballah.
* **Levant** refers to the geographical core of the conflict: Israel, Palestine, Gaza, Lebanon, Jordan.
* **Palestine** refers to the de-facto non-existant State of Palestine.
* **Palestinian Authority**, or **PA** refers to the autonomous council ruling the West Bank.
* **Racism** has its usual meaning, with a twist: In Israel Palestine
* **Zionism** refers to Israeli patriotism (that is, the Israeli meaning).

# The Parties Involved

I don't think it is rational to form a take on a conflict without first understanding the motives of all involved parties; Therfore, here's an alphabetical list of them, for your convenience.

## Israel

The current government is dependent on four things:
1. The Israeli population's acceptence of the need for the war (this is why a lot of Israelis oppose ceasefires; they truly believe the war is *needed*).
2. The Palestinian population's lack of ability to organize without support from bodys with different motives, such as [Iran], its proxies, or the [Palestinian Authority].
3. External Funding and Trade, due to [Netanjahu]'s abolishment of support for local farming, weapon factories, etc. the last decade,
   in addition to Obama restricting usage of American funding to American soil.

As the only directly involved organization that actually has a stable source of income (its population and the USA),

### Netanjahu

He's a classic case of political egoism; He's sure that without him, the State of Israel cannot survive, and therefore, to keep him on his throne (and in his point of view, to save Israel),
any action is justifiable; He cannot differiate between his own interests and the people's, and
he will do anything to remain in power, regardless of how it seems to harm his ideology, country, or party.

It is theorized by the Israeli Left and Center that Sarah Netanjahu, his wife, manipulates Netanjahu, and that she is the one to actually call the shots;
Regardless, [Ben Gvir] has him as a political hostage — in the last elections, Netanjahu did not win enough votes to become Prime Minister without allying with supremacist parties,
who can therefore exit the coalition any time, immediately ending Netanjahu's term. That is: Netanjahu is *not* fully in charge. Ben Gvir, and perhaps Sarah Netanjahu, are.
*This does not mean he's innocent of his countless crimes*.
