Hello hello! The blog was updated,
and a lot of changes were introduced!

If you were here when the stylesheet was borked, sorry, oops.

On the more likely option, you're exploring what's here cause you saw my singular
[JoinFedivri post](https://laxla.quest/blog/fedivri/2024/11/28/joinfedivri.html),
here are the updates:
* Added extremely quick functionality.
* Added a fancy menu at the top.
* Added groupings by category, year, and tag.
* Added disqus (it'll be removed soon, once I figure out how; I made these changes a very long time ago, and I'd prefer a completely static site).
* The site should look better on search engines.
* Lots of updates I forgor.
